# Jimmy Butler's Career so far

## Analysis of NBA All-Star Jimmy Butler since the start of his career using Data Visualization

>### Context

Jimmy Butler is nowadays the franchise player of the famous Miami Heat. Considered as one of the best all-around player in the NBA, Jimmy Butler is seen by some as the perfect leader for your team but for others he is seen as a toxic player around who you can't build a team.

Jimmy went through a lot since his debut at Marquette University, to his first NBA seasons at Chicago, then at Minnesota where things got a bit complicated, then moving to Philly to create a superteam with the Sixers and finally at Miami, Florida where the team is built around him and reaching heights that the fans of the Heat didn't see since LeBron left.

>### Objective

With this project, we are trying to understand Jimmy Butler's journey but also his story and see if we can explain this thanks to different data. 
To do so, we will be using Data Visualization to present the results of this study. 
Finally, to conclude this project, I decided to write an article in which I present the results found and my analysis on this project.
